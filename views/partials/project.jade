          | Civic Media is a modular, multimedia CMS that enables storytellers
          | to better guide their readers through complex stories. 
        p My contribution enabled authors to search for and integrate multimedia
          | content into FOLD. I also built the interface through which users
          | created, customized, and discovered other FOLD profiles.
          | This work was done in collaboration with Alexis Hope 
          | (lead designer and HCI researcher), Joe Goldbeck

        p.sub-title Background
        p On FOLD, authors are given more control over the context readers see. When a
          | reader unfolds a story, he or she is presented with a horizontal bar of context
          | intersecting the vertical scroll of cards which contains the main narrative.
          | Each vertical narrative card can be framed by horizontal “context” cards containing
          | videos, audio tracks, maps, gifs, data visualizations, pictures, tweets, or text.
        p Adding and discovering these multimedia context cards is made easy through the FOLD
          | authoring platform, which provides a consistent search, preview and selection
          | interface that abstracts away the APIs of each media service.

        p BuyForBaby is a baby registry that provides parents the ability to customize, organize and better account for items on their wish lists. 
        p The final web application is a culmination of a semester of learning and applying the design process. This process involved 
          span.pop ideation, user research to specify target groups and goals, storyboarding, wireframing, paper and computer prototyping, and testing.
        p BuyForBaby was developed in collaboration with teammates Aaron Hammond, Priya Kalluri and Lia Coleman for the User Interface Design and Implementation class at MIT.
        p.sub-title Background
        p After observing the fragmented and impersonal process of picking a gift for my sister’s first baby shower, I wondered how unnecessarily stressful it must be for parents to account for all the things they would need to care for their newborn. By studying more cases of registry use on both the gifter’s end and the parents’ (“giftee’s”) end, our team highlighted issues with the current landscape of registries and identified how a more specific and unifying interface layer could improve the shopping experience for both user groups.

        p Spending time at The Metals Lab at MIT gives me a chance to experiment and

        p I love working in this setting because it is a chance for my work to be
          | at the whim of processes that I have much less control over. 
          | Each material and piece transforms itself through a unique process each time.
          | The challenge in designing each piece lies in learning and predicting the
          | effects of each process as it stresses and changes the material.
        p Here are a sampling of pieces that I've made. Pictured below, a champlev&eacute; dandelion,

          | This included the integration of Google Maps API and developing features that allow users to search and filter for travellers in a given area.
          | This app was developed in collaboration with Kamilla Tekiela and Dang Pham and was inspired by our study abroad experiences in Spain and Israel.

        p Anisotropic is an indoor installation set up during Steer Roast, an art, music, and people watching event at MIT. I designed this project during the Spring of 2014 for 21M.734, Lighting Design.
        p  My goal with Anisotropic was two fold
          ol
            li On an emotional level, I wanted to design and create an atmosphere of calm and peace to juxtapose the craze that often accompanied a dorm-wide event like Steer Roast
            li On a technical level, I hoped to explore and highlight the intricate nature of light and its interaction with anisotropic material
        p The semester long design process led to the complete transformation of a 100 sq ft dorm lounge.
          | The room was surround with black stage curtains
          | that masked the light and sounds of the outdoor courtyard. 
        p Light from a 77 lumen LED, and a PAR38 Spotlight fitted with a 150W Halogen bulb were used to light the room.
          | Wire mesh, iridescent cellophane, and a small fan were used to guide the light to the ceiling of the room
