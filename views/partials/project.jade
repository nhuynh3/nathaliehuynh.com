        | My contribution to FOLD, in which I worked on the features
        | that allow authors to search for and integrate multimedia
        | content into their stories and the interface for which users
        | create, customize, and discover user accounts, was the subject
        | of my senior thesis. This work was done in collaboration with Alexis Hope 
        | (lead designer and HCI researcher), Joe Goldbeck
        | (lead developer), and Kevin Hu.

        | Hyperlinking and other methods used by authors to provide context,
        | create unpredictable user experiences and risk user retention as a
        | reader may find him/herself down a rabbit hole of loosely coupled information.
        br
        br
        | On FOLD, authors are given more control over the context readers see. When a
        | reader unfolds a story, he or she is presented with a horizontal bar of context
        | intersecting the vertical scroll of cards which contains the main narrative.
        | Each vertical narrative card can be framed by horizontal “context” cards containing
        | videos, audio tracks, maps, gifs, data visualizations, pictures, tweets, or text.
        | Adding and discovering these multimedia context cards is made easy through the FOLD
        | authoring platform, which provides a consistent search, preview and selection
        | interface that abstracts away the APIs of each media service.

      .proj-info BuyForBaby is a baby registry that provides parents the ability to customize, organize and better account for items on their wish lists.

        br
        | The final web application is a culmination of a semester of learning and applying the design process through ideation, user research to define user groups and goals, storyboarding, and iterations of prototyping and testing. BuyForBaby was developed in collaboration with teammates Aaron Hammond, Priya Kalluri and Lia Coleman for the User Interface Design and Implementation class at MIT.

        | After observing the fragmented and impersonal process of picking a gift for my sister’s first baby shower, I wondered how unnecessarily stressful it must be for parents to account for all the things they would need to care for their newborn. By studying more cases of registry use on both the gifter’s end and the parents’ (“giftee’s”) end, our team highlighted issues with the current landscape of registries and identified how a more specific and unifying interface layer could improve the shopping experience for both user groups.
