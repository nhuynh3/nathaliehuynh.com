            p On FOLD, authors are given more control over the context readers see. When a
              | reader unfolds a story, he or she is presented with a horizontal bar of context
              | intersecting the vertical scroll of cards which contains the main narrative.
              | Each vertical narrative card can be framed by horizontal “context” cards containing
              | videos, audio tracks, maps, gifs, data visualizations, pictures, tweets, or text.
            p Adding and discovering these multimedia context cards is made easy through the FOLD
              | authoring platform, which provides a consistent search, preview and selection
              | interface that abstracts away the APIs of each media service.

            p After observing the fragmented and impersonal process of picking a gift for my 
              | sister’s first baby shower, I wondered how unnecessarily stressful it must be 
              | for parents to account for all the things they would need to care for their 
              | newborn. 
            p By studying more cases of registry use on both the gifter’s end and 
              | the parents’ (“giftee’s”) end, our team highlighted issues with the current 
              | landscape of registries and identified how a more specific and unifying interface 
              | layer could improve the shopping experience for both user groups.

              p Following rounds of paper prototyping, testing, and iteration, the group developed a high fidelty computer prototype.
