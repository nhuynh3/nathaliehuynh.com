        | On FOLD, authors are given more control over the context readers see. When a
        | reader unfolds a story, he or she is presented with a horizontal bar of context
        | intersecting the vertical scroll of cards which contains the main narrative.
        | Each vertical narrative card can be framed by horizontal “context” cards containing
        | videos, audio tracks, maps, gifs, data visualizations, pictures, tweets, or text.
        | Adding and discovering these multimedia context cards is made easy through the FOLD
        | authoring platform, which provides a consistent search, preview and selection
        | interface that abstracts away the APIs of each media service.

        | After observing the fragmented and impersonal process of picking a gift for my sister’s first baby shower, I wondered how unnecessarily stressful it must be for parents to account for all the things they would need to care for their newborn. By studying more cases of registry use on both the gifter’s end and the parents’ (“giftee’s”) end, our team highlighted issues with the current landscape of registries and identified how a more specific and unifying interface layer could improve the shopping experience for both user groups.
